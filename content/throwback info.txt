Throwback blocks and units are from the oldest surviving version of indev Infinitus,
when it was called 'baby-core', and everything was (more) unbalanced.
Oddly enough, Dark Corvus existed, and the sprite for Removal's point defense existed, but was unused,
and has been modified for the newer versions.
All stats are unchanged, it's mostly a direct copy-paste, but the bundle has been replaced with 'name' and
'description' attributes for the actual content. Nothing is officially obtainable, but I may use it in the
Chrono campaign, seeing as it's mostly Meepium stuff that was ported, which turned into Temporum,
and Chrono is time-based, and time... Old stuff... No?
